# Return Youtube Dislikes
Android app to get youtube statistics:
- Video image
- Likes Count
- Dislikes Count
- Date Created
- Rating
- View Count

<br>

## Built with
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Retrofit2
- Glide
- <a href="https://www.returnyoutubedislike.com/">RYD API</a>

<br>

## How does the API/Backend work?
The backend is using archived data from when the youtube api was still returning the dislike count, extension users like/dislike count and extrapolation. In the near future we will be allowing content creators to submit their dislike count easily and safely and we will be adding ArchiveTeam's archived data (4.56 billion videos) into our current database. You can also view a video on the topic.
